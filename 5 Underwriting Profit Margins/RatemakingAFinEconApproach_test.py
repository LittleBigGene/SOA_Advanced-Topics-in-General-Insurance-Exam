        #  It is usually lower than actual equity and thus will lead to a lower profit margin, which may lead to investment in risky assets.
        #  It ignores the time value of money.

        #   • It is difficult to allocate equity to policies.
        #   • It considers only one policy term, not renewal cycles.
        #   • Actual taxes may not be at the corporate rate.
        #   • Expenses may depend on the premium rate.
