    # 3 Capital Asset Pricing Model

    #   Two      Asset Allocation Case - simply a weighted average of each asset's expected return
    #   Multiple Asset Allocation Case

    #   Efficient Frontier

    #   Some cautions about using the CAPM must be mentioned
    #   The model requires theuse of the market risk premium and past market portfolio returns and individual asset returns to arrive at beta estimatesfor individual assets
    #   This assumesthat such relationshipsare stable, when in fact they are likely to changeover time. 

    #   Assumptions of the Captial Asset Pricing Model
    #   • Investors are risk averse diversifiers who try to maximize expected return and minimize risk.
    #   • Investors are price takers, in that they act as if their trades have no effect on asset prices.
    #   • Investors have identical expectations about asset expected returns and standard deviations.
    #   • Investors have no transaction costs or taxes.
    #   • Investors can borrow or invest at the risk-free rate without any limit.
    #   • Assets are infinitely divisible.
