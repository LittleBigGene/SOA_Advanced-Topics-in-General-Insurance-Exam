        #c) Describe two areas of additional analysis that you may conduct to provide further comfort regarding the outcomes from the deployment of this framework.

        #d) Identify four approaches that can be used to analyze independent sources of risk.

        #e  One of the attractions of this framework is that each of the sources of uncertainty being
        #   analyzed can be aligned with the central estimate analysis and appropriate decisions around volatility made in the context of that analysis.
        #   Your actuarial student proposes analyzing risk margins at the same granular level as used for central estimate valuation purposes.

        # Evaluate your student’s proposal.
        # Commentary on Question:
        # Three of the following four statements are sufficient to earn full credit.
        #  May not be possible to work at the granular level
        #  Information may not be credible
        #  May be costly to work at the granular level
        #  Extra detail may not provide material improvement

        # Parameter selection error for internal systemic risk
        # Random component of parameter risk

        #   Explain why using the approach of part (b) may not be appropriate.

        #   Any two of the following were sufficient for full credit.
        #   • The normal distribution may not be appropriate for an extreme percentile.
        #   • The internal systemic risk correlation in the extreme tails may be more than 25%.
        #   • There may be other risk drivers than those used.
