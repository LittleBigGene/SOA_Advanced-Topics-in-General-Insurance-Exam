        # Any three of the following is sufficient to earn full credit.
        #  Commonly used methods are complex and require a lot of data. The benefits may not outweigh the costs.
        #  Correlations are heavily influenced by correlations in past data and may not accurately reflect the true values.
        #  It is difficult to separate past results into independent and systemic components.
        #  Internal systemic risk cannot be modeled using standard correlation modeling techniques.

        # For outstanding claim liabilities, longer run-off implies higher volatility and hence a higher coefficient of variation.

        #c) Describe two areas of additional analysis that you may conduct to provide further comfort regarding the outcomes from the deployment of this framework.
        #  Sensitivity testing: Vary each assumption to see the effect on risk margins.
        #  Scenario testing: Tie outcomes to a set of valuation outcomes.
        #  Internal benchmarking: For each source of uncertainty compare the coefficients of variation between classes for various liabilities.
        #  External benchmarking: Review differences between benchmarks and the claim portfolio being analyzed.
        #  Hindsight analysis: Compare past estimates against the latest view of the equivalent liabilities.

        #d) Identify four approaches that can be used to analyze independent sources of risk.
        #  Mack method
        #  Bootstrapping
        #  Stochastic chain ladder
        #  Generalized linear models
        #  Bayesian

        #e  One of the attractions of this framework is that each of the sources of uncertainty being
        #   analyzed can be aligned with the central estimate analysis and appropriate decisions around volatility made in the context of that analysis.
        #   Your actuarial student proposes analyzing risk margins at the same granular level as used for central estimate valuation purposes.

        # Evaluate your student’s proposal.

        # Three of the following four statements are sufficient to earn full credit.
